This is a short personal memo about static/shared libraries loading process.

## Static libraries

Static libraries on Linux have the `.a` extension (for `archive`).
This section goes througout the static library creation process in details.

### Write C code

First, let's write some C code for our library. Our library is divided into four files:
 * `sum.c` and `sum.h` that contains a sum function definition and declaration,
 * `mul.c` and `mul.h` that contains a multiplication function definition and declaration

```c
/* sum.c */

#include "sum.h"

#include "mul.h" // declaration required as mul() is used below

int sum_and_mul(int first, int second) {
    return first + mul(first, second);
}
```

```c
/* mul.c */

#include "mul.h"

int mul(int first, int second) {
    return first * second;
}
```

```c
/* sum.h */

int sum_and_mul(int first, int second);
```

```c
/* mul.h */

int mul(int first, int second);
```

### Generate object files

Object files are `compiled` files but not `linked` files.
That means `symbols` are `not resolved` from one object to another.

For example, two object files are generated for the two sources files `sum.c` and `mul.c`:
 * `mul.o` has no symbols to other objects, so it has no unresolved symbols,
 * `sum.o` has the symbol `mul` that is defined into the `mul.o` object, this symbol is unresolved

This is fine for now, the files are supposed to be grouped together later.

The two generated object files can be represented as follow:

The files are generated through the following command:

```sh
gcc -c mul.c -o mul.o
gcc -c sum.c -o sum.o
```
